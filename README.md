# Particles' Rules of Attraction Simulator

Program simulating particles' rules of attraction. 

It's heavily inspired by [hunar4321's life_code](https://github.com/hunar4321/life_code) (still most of my code is just his javascript code ported to Go).

## Gif

500 particles of each color:

Different amounts of each color of particles:

* 100 red particles
* 1500 green particles
* 500 blue particles
* 1200 yellow particles

## Roadmap (if I have time and energy to put into it)

- [ ] User Interface: changing rules live
- [ ] User Interface: adding/removing new types (colors) of particles
- [ ] User Interface: rules import/export
- [x] computation parallelization
- [ ] rule mutations
- [ ] optimalizations :v (always ongoing)
